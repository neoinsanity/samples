samples
=======

This is where I keep my sample code, as I learn how to write in python.

The rule for navigating the samples is very easy. The name of the package path is the the name of the library prefixed with 'my' that I am learning. By way of example, the study of pyzmq leads to the samples in samples.mypyzmq.
